A giant tidal wave was coming in but the beach became my house and I didn’t know what to save. I started running from the wave but then realized my dream diary was back there. I ran back and tried to save it. I wanted to keep everything. The bedside table was there (a box) and I piled it full of books, not knowing where my dream diary was exactly.'

It jumps and bounces on the bed so the kittens are mid air and the fat cat grips the head board with its claws. A large truck pulls up. It has on the back of it a giant plastic version of the Belvedere boiler cast in a crystal clear material. A crowd of people unload it from the tow truck and start to dust it with feather dusters. The kittens crawl cutely towards the big boiler as though it is their mom, leaving big fat cat on the headboard while they take their places in its coal holes.'

I have many things to put in and then a woman comes along who is elderly and has one sweater that appears to be chainmail. It takes priority as it’s one and not many, so I put my things aside. As she continues with the washing machine I pass the machine and notice a steamer. I start to steam the floors, then the machine stops. TONY comes and says the debit/visa is broken down and he rips one off a self checkout station and plugs it into the steamer and it starts working again. INT. domestic house setting. I’m there to battle another force.I have my body suited up like Matt Damon in Elysium. Im laying in bed with Mia and there’s a broken mirror on the floor beside us. She takes a photo of our reflection with her IPhone and shows it to me. I lay on my back and look up to the ceiling- a white bunch of material unravels and drops itself. It looks like silk or a gauze textile. Mia whispers, “Only white spiders Move backwards.”'

I find ridiculous baby shirts for my niece. A search for the women’s washroom leads to a job interview. Unidentifiable institution but we’re just hanging out. Topic turns to cocaine and I understand we are in Holland. Job interviewer presents me with a beautiful card at the end, she made for me with thick gobs of lipstick. I touch it and it smears.'
